    "text": "Species distribution modeling (SDM) relates species occurrence data to environmental predictors with the aim of estimating habitat suitability across space.\nThis document provides a minimal, reproducible SDM workflow in \\(R\\) using the sdm package (Naimi and Araujo 2016) version 1.2.67.\n\n\n\n#install.packages('sdm') # In case you do not have it installed already\nlibrary(sdm)\n\nLoading required package: terra\n\n\nterra 1.8.86\n\n\nsdm 1.2-59 (2025-07-13)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use data which comes with the package as that would be the easiest way to begin using the package. This data has presence (1) and absence (0) records of a virtual species. We will read it into \\(R\\) using the vect function from terra package (Abatzoglou et al. 2018) which is loaded whenever you load sdm.\n\nsp &lt;- vect(system.file(\"external/species.shp\", package = \"sdm\"))\nsp\n\n class       : SpatVector \n geometry    : points \n dimensions  : 200, 1  (geometries, attributes)\n extent      : 110112, 606053, 4013700, 4275600  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\n source      : species.shp\n coord. ref. : WGS 84 / UTM zone 30N (EPSG:32630) \n names       : Occurrence\n type        :      &lt;num&gt;\n values      :          1\n                        0\n                        1\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from the occurrence records, we also need to load the predictor variables. There are four raster layers which come with the package and we will load them alongside the occurrence records to help in building the model. These are also often referred to as response variables. We will use rast function also from terra package (Abatzoglou et al. 2018).\n\npreds &lt;- rast(list.files(system.file(\"external\", package = \"sdm\"), pattern = \".asc$\", full.names = TRUE))\npreds\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 71, 124, 4  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 4219.223, 4219.223  (x, y)\nextent      : 100975.3, 624159, 3988830, 4288395  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. :  \nsources     : elevation.asc  \n              precipitation.asc  \n              temperature.asc  \n              vegetation.asc  \nnames       : elevation, precipitation, temperature, vegetation \n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to visualize the output so that you confirm how the occurrence records, both presence and absence, are distributed over the environmental variable(s), (see Figure 1).\n\nplot(preds$vegetation)\nplot(sp[sp$Occurrence == 1, ], col = \"blue\", add = TRUE)\nplot(sp[sp$Occurrence == 0, ], col = \"red\", add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of occurrence points over the region of interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the distribution of the occurrence records, the next step is to create an \\(sdmData\\) object.

This is the data we supply to the sdm function to train the model.\n\n\n\nIn building the sdm model, we provide our formula and the \\(d\\) object.

For that we need to binarize the suitability map so that we have presence (1) or absence (0). However, since the suitability map is continuous, it is difficult to strike a balance on where to pick the threshold. For this, we can go with a threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. However, depending on the research objective, one may decide to use different threshold. For example, when trying to identify potential areas for conserving an endangered species, one may use lower thershold so that more area is considered present locations and demarcated for conservation, etc. Here we will go with the threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity.\n\npa &lt;- pa(x = p, y = m, id = \"ensemble\", opt = 2)\nplot(pa, col = c(\"darkgreen\", \"gray80\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Presence absence binary map for the species"
